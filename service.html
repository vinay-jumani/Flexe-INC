                <p class="res-p" style="font-size: 15px;" >
                    Data migration is the process of transferring data from one system, storage, or format to another. This can be done for various reasons, including upgrading to a new system, consolidating data, moving to a cloud-based infrastructure, or complying with data retention requirements. Data migration is a critical and often complex task that requires careful planning and execution to ensure that data is transferred accurately, securely, and without loss or corruption. Here are the key steps and considerations involved in data migration:<br><br>
                    Planning:

Define the scope and objectives of the migration.Identify the source and target systems or platforms.Determine the type of data to be migrated (e.g., structured data, unstructured data, databases, files, emails).Create a detailed migration plan, including timelines and milestones.
Data Assessment:
Analyze the data to be migrated. This involves understanding data types, formats, quality, and dependencies.Determine which data is essential and needs to be migrated and what can be archived or discarded.<br><br>

Data Mapping:
Map the source data to the target data structure. This involves matching fields, tables, or elements from the source to the destination.Address any discrepancies or data transformations required during migration.

Data Extraction:
Extract data from the source system. This may involve using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools or custom scripts.

Data Transformation:
If necessary, data may need to be transformed or cleaned to meet the requirements of the target system.This can include data normalization, data validation, and data enrichment.

Data Loading:
Load the transformed data into the target system or platform.Ensure that data is inserted in the correct format and that data relationships are maintained.<br><br>

Testing:
Thoroughly test the migration process to ensure data integrity and accuracy.Conduct testing in a controlled environment to identify and resolve any issues or discrepancies.

Validation:
Validate the migrated data against the source data to confirm that the migration was successful.Verify that the data in the target system matches the data in the source system.
